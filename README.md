## Update 2017-10-26: Eric Snow
Wanting to learn more about MonoGame I pulled down TBS.  To start out I decided I would update the project to use the latest version of the framework.  All credit to Nicolas Faure for developing all of the TBS source code in the project this one was forked from.

* Updated to work with MonoGame 3.6 and Visual Studio 2017.  
* Moved content to use the MonoGame Pipeline Tool and the Content.mgcb file.
* Update Menu.spritefont to use Arial font rather than Segoe UI Mono which wasn't available on my system.

MonoGame 3.6 will need to be installed to get the MonoGame Pipeline Tool and to build this code:
